    <div id="Lore"> So you found me... I am surprised. So smart yet a fool.. anyways I have a thing to tell you something.
    <br> The reason I help you is not because I want you to become the strongest but.. Me.. And you are just helping me.
    <br> The moment you get all glyphs I'll take them all! And you won't be able to do anything.
    <br> You think if you become so strong that you'll kill me.. But I am stronger than you can ever imagine..
    <br> I have my Celestials.. And they are the strongest beigns in this Life! Only I can control them no one else.. </div>
